<br>
I've shared the tasks for the internship below.
<br>
<br>
Task 1 - Create a program that generates a random number and asks the user to guess it. Provide feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low until the user guesses the correct number.

<br>
<br>
Play Again: ask if the players want to play another game.
<br>
<br>




<br>
Task 3 - Build a simple console-based to-do list manager that allows users to add, view, and delete tasks.
<br>
Task Input: Allow users to input tasks they want to add to the list.
<br>
<br>
Add Task: Implement a function to add tasks to the list.
<br>
<br>
